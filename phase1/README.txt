When cloning our program, it needs to be setup such that group_0331 is the working directory. 
Otherwise, our relative file paths will not work. ATM_machine is the top level module and it
is where you should run the program from. You will interact will the console to use this 
program. It will give you prompts of what to type in. 

When first running the program, you will need to login as bankManager using the 
username: manager and password: password. From the bank manager's account you have the 
option to create new users accounts and to approve different types of accounts that users
have requested. After creating a user you can logout from bankmanager and login to that 
user's account if you wish.
